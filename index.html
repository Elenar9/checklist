    <h2 id="headline">Singing Bowl History</h2>
    <p>The history of singing bowls begins at a time and culture with few writting records long before the advent of modern industrialization. The first metal bowls
  were likely made of pure copper well over 5,000 years ago. Brass a mixture of copper with other metals,is a later technology still thousands of years old. 
  There are stories that 2,000 year old brass bowls were in Tibet at the turn of the last century.</p>

    <h3>What Were Singing Bowls Used For?</h3>       
    <p>I have done some research into the instances of brass and copper bowl use documented in Nepal and Tibet by English language sources pu`ished sources prior to 1950. The most common uses I found were for storage of water and grains and for use as bowls and cups. There were a number of references to brass bowls being a common dowry item or wedding gift which would attest to their practical utility. 
Bowls were used in conjunction with charcoal and tobacco. I came across to one reference where a bowl was used for divination (via reading a broken egg). There are relatively few references to bowls and sounds. In a way this isn't surprising as many inner practices were entirely hidden from outsiders, especially in virtually inaccessible Tibet.

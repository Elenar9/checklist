        <h3><p>The history of singing bowls begins at a time and culture with few writting     records long before the advent of modern industrialization. The first metal bowls
    were likely made of pure copper well over 5,000 years ago. Brass
    a mixture of copper with other metals,is a later technology still thousands of             yearsold. 
   There are stories that 2,000 year old brass bowls were in Tibet at the turn of the last century. </p></h3></div>

       <p><strong>What Were Singing Bowls Used For? </strong><br>
  <br>       
    I have done some research into the instances of brass and copper bowl use documented in Nepal and Tibet by English language sources published sources prior to 1950. The most common uses I found were for storage of water and grains and for use as bowls and cups. There were a number of references to brass bowls being a common dowry item or wedding gift which would attest to their practical utility. 
  Bowls were used in conjunction with charcoal and tobacco. I came across to one reference where a bowl was used for divination (via reading a broken egg). There are relatively few references to bowls and sounds. In a way this isn’t surprising as many inner practices were entirely hidden from outsiders, especially in virtually inaccessible Tibet.
